    <h3 align="center">Some of the many projects I have created are listed below.</h3><br>
        Here's a summarised list of all the significant programs created by me using various programming languages. The links to GitHub repositories will be updated soon for all the major projects. Enjoy!<br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>School Election Software</li>
            <p>Created a program in Visual Studio for the election of student council in school under the guidance of computer teacher. A form asks the voter about his/her class, roll number and house. A list of candidates is displayed for the selected house. A student can vote for one candidate from each category. The votes are then stored in a MS Access database, which when sorted by highest to lowest in number of votes, gives the winner. The process saves tons of paper, time required to print ballot paper and count them and errors in counting too!</p>
        <li>Quadratic Equation Solver</li>
            <p>Created a program in CodeBlocks IDE with C language, to solve complex quadratic equations. The program takes input from the user in terms of coefficient of x<sup>2</sup>, coefficient of x and the constant term. It calculates the roots using the quadratic formula!</p>
        <li>Calculator</li>
            <p>Created a calculator in Visual Studio for basic arithmetic calculations with a rich GUI. Working on a new version which will include many in-built as well as programmable functions, making it a virtual programmable scientific calculator!</p>
        <li>Stock Performance Tracker</li>
            <p>Created a webpage using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, which returns various fields like current quote, P/E ratio, graph, market capitalization, etc. for a given stock. The webpage takes the stock ticker (eg. AAPL) as input, and using the APIs from Yahoo! Finance, returns the mentioned data on click of a button!</p>
        <li>Age Calculator</li>
            <p>Created a ASPX.NET program embedded in a HTML website which takes the user's DOB as input and the current date from the system. It then calculates the difference berween the two dates, which is the number of days. The number of days are then divided by 365 to get the age in years, the age in years is multiplied by 12 to get the age in number of months, the number of days are multiplied by 24, 60 and 60, which gives the age in hours, minutes and seconds respectively!</p>
        <li>Net Worth Calculator</li>
            <p>Created a C program which asks the user for cash and cash equivalents, investments, and personal items, which are categorized under 'Assets'; and many types of loans, mortgages, outstandings, etc. which form 'Liabilities'. The program then calculates the Net Worth of the user in different currencies as per the day's exchange rate!</p>
