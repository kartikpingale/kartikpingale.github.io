# About Me

I love working on problems that require structured thinking, quantitative analysis, and clear communication — whether that’s valuing companies, analyzing markets, building models, or turning complex data into actionable insights. With a background spanning finance, engineering, and research, I’m drawn to roles where analytical depth and intellectual curiosity matter.
